# Tic Tac Toe Game in Spring Boot

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework. This project is a classic implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Human vs. Human)
- Player vs. Bot with adjustable difficulty levels
- Game board visualization
- Move validation
- Game state tracking (In progress, Ended, Draw)
- Command line interaction
